**ner-d** is a Python module for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using natural language processing. Named entity recognition (NER) (also known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entity mentions in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as the person
names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

Gives you easy use with a single main function and flexibility for selecting language models. It automatically downloads models if not downloaded before and links on system and finds the entities from given text block.
